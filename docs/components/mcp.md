# Master Control Program (MCP)

*(Placeholder)*

This component is planned but not yet implemented.

## Purpose

The MCP is the **central orchestration component** in the ACS-AI-AGENTS system.
Its primary role is to coordinate communication between different agents, manage agent registration/discovery, and route messages/requests to the appropriate specialized agents.

It acts as the central system that knows about all available agents and directs work accordingly.

## Planned Functionality

*   Receive incoming requests/messages (e.g., incident reports, analysis requests).
*   Maintain a registry of available agents and their capabilities.
*   Identify the appropriate agent(s) based on message type or required capabilities.
*   Route messages to the relevant agent(s).
*   Manage agent lifecycle and potentially health checks.
*   Potentially handle response aggregation or coordination if multiple agents are involved.
*   Provide a unified entry point API for external systems to interact with the agent ecosystem.
